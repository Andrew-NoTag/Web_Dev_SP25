# KoalaKitchen

## Design

Ask my friend Lim to make a logo. (no use yet)
<img src="KoalaKitchen.png" alt="logo" style="width:30%; height:auto;">

Find a good [template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1077384985779045508) on Figma Community.
Modify base on the template. Here is a [link](https://www.figma.com/design/rRASUlkOFE9ZfSy6c7Wwjr/Koala-Kitchen?node-id=1-2&t=Nh3uRBLWCjXMyMSR-1) to my figma project.

## Coding

### Create React App

Since I have already installed Node.js, I created a new React app. I used [this link](https://medium.com/@adityasrivast/reactjs-understanding-package-json-e8cdf408a3df) as a reference to update my `package.json` file

```bash
npx create-react-app koala-kitchen
npm install react-scripts
```

```json
{
  "name": "koala-kitchen",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [">0.2%", "not dead", "not op_mini all"],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

Update compile instruction to `README.md`

I used [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_getstarted.asp) to figure out my project structure and starter code.
I used [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_render.asp) as a reference to learn how to render HTML. This is what I did in `index.js`:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Navigation Bar

I tried a simple navigation bar and see if the app works.

Nothing show up... But when I inspect elements, I can see those elements. I doubt that the google font hasn't properly loaded.

Okay it is not the font's problem because when I changed the google font to `Arial, sans-serif` still doesn't work
![bug1](bug1.png)

It turns out that I use `100%` for width and height, but it doesn't have a parent container, so the dependency doesn't work. I change it to relative to window size:

```js
<div
  style={{
    width: "100vw",
    height: "100vh",
    position: "relative",
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
>
  {/*other divs*/}
</div>
```

Naming css file as `NavBar.css` doesn't work, it has to be `NavBar.module.css`. Don't know why :(

Navigation bar is done.

### Homepage

Using CSS code generated by Figma, with my own modification, homepage is done.
Used flex box, in which have two columns. The left column contains introduction and buttons, the right column contains a photo gallery (for now, it is only a static picture, will make it a gallery in the future release)

```html
<div className="{styles.homepage}">
  <div>
    {/* left side: introduction, buttons */}
    <div className="{styles.intro}">
      Reserve a Private
      <span className="{styles.highlight}">Cantonese</span> Meal with Chef
      Zhang. Koala-Approved!
    </div>
    <div className="{styles.buttonContainer}">
      <div className="{styles.menuButton}">View Menu</div>
      <div className="{styles.hoursButton}">Hours</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  {/* right side: image gallery */}
  <div className="{styles.image}"></div>
</div>
```

### Footer

Developing footer, find out that there is a default margin around elements:
![default margin](bug2.png)
Modify `index.css`:

```css
html,
body {
  background: #ffefe8;
  /* remove default margin */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

Add `user-select: none` to every "Koala Kitchen" title, since when it is selected, the dark blue background doesn't look good.

In footer, three columns were used. Like the homepage, I used flex box to locate items. Footer done.

### Menu Page
I wanna add a separate menu page.
