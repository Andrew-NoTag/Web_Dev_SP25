# KoalaKitchen: Lazy-Friendly Meal Planner

<img src="KoalaKitchen.png" style="width:50%">

## Overview

**KoalaKitchen** is a meal-planning web app designed to create a bridge between your kitchen skills and user's cravings. When the hungry users book meals for specific dishes specified on your menu, a _Weee!_ shopping list will automatically generated by subtracting your fridge inventory from the ingredients needed for user-selected recipes. In the future, we are looking forward to integrate the auto shopping feature, which will automatically add necessary ingredients to your cart. By just one click, your ingredients will be ready and let's surprise our customers.

## Motivation / Inspiration

As someone who always forgets what's already in the fridge, I wanted to create a tool that simplifies the preparing process for my fellow chefs. Inspired by koalas, who have relaxing life and eat only poisoned leaves but still alive, here are some of my motivations:

- **For the Chef:**
  - No more mental math for grocery lists
  - Centralizing tracking of reservations and fridge items
- **For the Hungry Customers:**
  - Browse available dishes like in a food delivery app
  - Guarantee the chef has the ingredients to cook your favorite dishes

## Technical Stack
