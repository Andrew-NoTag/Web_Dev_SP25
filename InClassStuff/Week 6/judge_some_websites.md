# Judge Some Websites

## Good Examples

1. [apple.com](https://www.apple.com/)
   - Clean and clear design
   - Only necessary information on homepage, details are displayed in the detail page.
   - Great user interaction guidance. For example, `Learn more` and `Buy now` buttons
   - Fancy detail pages. For example, animation that responses to page scrolling.
2. [deepseek.com](https://www.deepseek.com/)
   - Clear layout design
   - Data table clearly shows the advantages and disadvantages of their products

## Bad Examples

1. [Rhizome's Net Art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/)
   - Artworks do not aligned
   - Background color changes when my cursor move to a different artwork. But the colors are too brights, which easy to make people visual fatigue.
2. ## [Tech Kids Unlimited](https://techkidsunlimited.org/)
    - Color tone is dissonance, use too many colors on the page
    - Icon styles do not match. For example, some button are rectangles, some buttons are rounded rectangles. Even rounded rectangles are not with the same radius
    - Messy layout.
