# Artwork Reflection

The work I chose is Cao Fei's _RMB City_. It's a virtual 3D modeling created on the platform Second Life. It is an imaginary, refactoring contemporary city in China, blending modern and traditional elements. From her hyperbolic modeling we can see that some iconic landmarks are presented in an unfamiliar way, such as president Mao's statue is floating in the water, the Bird's Nest Stadium is rusted, a national flag and a panda is floating in the sky, and so on. Such sharp contracts with my familiar reality strikes me with interesting, because it produces a humor, irony, and surrealism lens to view the modern Chinese society. It is also new in the media it was presented, since it was a relatively early piece of 3D modeling.

This work was created in 2008, the year of the Beijing Olympics. This is the time that the world was impressed by China. Cao Fei's work, on the other hand, demonstrates an ironic model of China. She did not chose to pander when the prevailing voice is compliment. It reminds me the strict censorship of art works in China, by which such ironic work might not have a chance to exhibit.
