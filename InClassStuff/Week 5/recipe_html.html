    <p>
      This is a recipe for <em>white cut chicken</em>, which is my
      <strong>favorite</strong> Cantonese dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese name for the dish (白切鸡 – <em>bak chit gai</em> in Cantonese
      or <em>bai qie ji</em> in Mandarin) translates to
      <em>white cut chicken</em>. It’s named as such because it’s poached in
      water and results in what is technically a very plain dish, like a pure,
      blank piece of paper.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the chicken:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3-4 pound whole chicken</li>
      <li>2 scallions</li>
      <li>5 slices ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons scallions</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ginger</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sure your chicken is at room temperature (trying to poach a cold
        chicken right out of the refrigerator will result in uneven cooking or
        undercooking). Clean the chicken by rinsing it under cold water, paying
        special attention to the cavity. Any giblets should already be removed
        but there may still be organs on the inside that should be removed or
        sometimes stray feathers that need to be plucked. Experts recommend that
        it's not necessary to wash your chicken before cutting and cooking but
        in this case for a whole chicken (especially if you get it from a live
        poultry place or even from Asian markets), it's a step that shouldn't be
        skipped, in my opinion. When washing and prepping the whole chicken, be
        very careful about splashing water and contaminating surfaces with
        unwanted bacteria. Be careful not to break or trim away any of the skin
        on the chicken, as you don’t want the meat exposed to the boiling water
        as it cooks. This will ensure a moist, silky texture in the final
        product.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large stock pot with water, just enough to submerge the chicken
        completely. You can determine this by putting the entire chicken in the
        pot, filling it with water until the chicken is submerged, and then
        removing the chicken. Do not turn on the heat while the chicken is still
        in the pot! This method of ensuring you have just enough water to
        submerge the chicken (and avoiding any extra) will ensure you have a
        more flavorful stock to save at the end. We used about 18 cups of water
        to submerge a 4 pound chicken in a deep stock pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have your water properly measured into the pot, add 2 scallions
        and 5 slices of ginger, and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, slowly
        lower the chicken into the pot, legs down and head up. It’s ok if the
        breast is peeking out of the water a bit. The water will cool down and
        stop boiling when you add the chicken, so bring it up to a boil once
        again, and do not walk away from the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the water boils again, IMMEDIATELY lift the chicken out of the
        water very carefully. You can carefully hook two wooden spoons under the
        wings to lift the chicken up. The goal is to empty any colder water that
        may be trapped inside the cavity. Once you’ve released that water, lower
        the chicken back into the pot, and bring to a boil again.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the water is JUST starting to boil, turn the heat down. Keep it at
        barely a simmer. There should be very little movement in the water, but
        it also shouldn’t be still. Cover the pot, and keep the heat around the
        lowest setting so the liquid continues to simmer slowly. Cook for about
        35-40 minutes, roughly 10-11 minutes per pound. Depending on the size of
        your chicken, it may take more or less time to cook it through. You can
        check to make sure the water is bubbling slowly/gently and not boiling
        too vigorously, but try to avoid uncovering the pot while it’s cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Poke a chopstick or skewer into the thigh to check for doneness. If the
        juices run clear, it's done. Carefully lift the chicken out of the pot
        and transfer it to a large bowl of ice water. Cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooling, make the sauce. You have the option to
        make two versions—one with just scallions, ginger, oil and salt, and one
        with soy sauce. The plain version is more traditional, as it really lets
        the flavors of chicken, ginger, and scallion shine through. Judy loves
        to add soy sauce, and it’s also a tasty option! Start with the plain
        version, and then scoop some of it out into another bowl and add soy
        sauce. Try both and see which your loved ones like best!
      </li>
      <li>
        When the chicken is out of the ice water, you can brush it lightly with
        oil or some of the fat floating atop the poaching liquid to give it that
        enticing, shiny look!
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, carve your chicken into pieces that you can easily grab with
        chopsticks. Serve with your sauce(s) and some steamed rice.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t forget to save the chicken stock and freeze it for later! You can
      also use it in place of water to cook rice!
